# Structure



* program name
* parameters
* modifiers
*   sample -> command -flag1 -flag2 arg1 arg2

    `flags` are used to tell command how we want to perform a particular action
*   commands can be written with a single `-` (for `flags`). For example, these two commands do the same thing:

    ```bash
    $ ls -l -h 
    $ ls -lh 
    ```
* dot (`.`) -> current directory
* double dot (`..`) -> parent directory
* tilde -virguilla in Spanish- (`~`) -> go to home folder

Note: PC keystroke of `~` -> AltGr + 4

**All commands can be searched with the command `man`.**
