# Searching



```
grep [pattern] [file_name]            -> searches for a specific pattern in a file
grep -r [pattern] [directory_name]    -> searches recursively for a specific pattern in a directory
locate [name]                         -> finds all files and directories by a specific name
find [/folder/location] -name [a]     -> lists names that begin with [a] in [/folder/location]
find [/folder/location] -size [+100M] -> lists files larger than 100M in a particular folder
```
