# Compress files



```
zip [name.zip] [file to compress] -> add or replace the entries in a zip file from the list, which can include the special name to compress the entry

upzip <file>                      -> unzip a .zip
-vl                               -> doesn't decompress but sees what is inside

tar                               -> it's a command similar to zip, it joins several files into one without compressing them. Then a compression algorithm is dictated, which is zip
cfz [file.tar.gz]                 -> put together and compress
xfz [file .tar.gz]                -> unzip
```
